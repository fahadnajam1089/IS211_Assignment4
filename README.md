I'm having a lot of trouble commiting the files from Pycharm or through Git bash. Sometimes the option comes up, and sometimes it doesn't and I can't seem to understand why not. Additionally, when it does come up, it keeps telling me that I already have git running and to remove the files. But I check the processes and there is nothing there. Please advise.
